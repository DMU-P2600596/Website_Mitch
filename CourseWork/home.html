    <h2>Below you can see a synopsis for one of biggest movie classics of all time which is of course Back To The Future</h2>
    <p>In this 1980s sci-fi classic, small-town California teen Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is thrown back into the '50s when an experiment by his eccentric scientist friend Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) goes awry. Traveling through time in a modified DeLorean car, Marty encounters young versions of his parents (Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson), and must make sure that they fall in love or he'll cease to exist. Even more dauntingly, Marty has to return to his own time and save the life of Doc Brown.</p>

    <h2>If that synopsis isn't enough for you you can check out the trailer below and see what all the fuss is about</h2>
